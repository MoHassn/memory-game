You only need a browser to run the game
the game runs well on firefox and there's something weird on chrome(The clicks selects random cards)

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Notes

### There's something weird with the Game and I can not fix it.
When I click the second card it does not open and the game makes the checks without showing it,
and if there is a match it shows it. Although I checked out the classList for the card and logged
it on the console and it's updated and contains the 'open' class but the HTML doesn't change and of course
the CSS of the class 'open' is not applied.
